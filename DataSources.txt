After each event on Magic: the Gathering Online (MtGO) Wizards of the Coast (WotC) publishes the deck lists of players that went undefeated in the even. 
I was able to find articles that included the deck lists for events going back to March 2018 for a total of 1041 decks.
I was able to extract the card names from the page source for each article using Matlab.
I also found a database of all Magic cards at:

Here are the articles:
